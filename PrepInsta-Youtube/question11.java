/*

Given a number N, the task is to split the num into multiple parts in such a fashion as to find the highest product.
 
Print the highest product value. 

Consider N=4, Best: 4 = 2*2 and 2*2 = 4. 

Similarly for N=6, 3*3=9

For N=8, 2*3*3=18

For N=15, 3*3*3*3*3=243

Input: 4 Output: 4
Input: 6 Output: 9
Input: 8 Output: 18
